# QAZ Cases by Greg Leo (whydobearsxplod)

All of these cases work with the QAZ pcb available on [Coffee Break Keyboards](http://cbkbd.com), and all use m2 10mm standoffs and m2 screws to secure the pcb/plate assembly to the case. All the prints shown are printed with [FilaCube Living Coral Filament](https://amzn.to/3Z6NyRl) on an AnyCubic i3 Mega S.
